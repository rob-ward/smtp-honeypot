The SMTP Java application that has been developed can be used as part of a network or on its own to capture SMTP traffic. The application can be setup to listen to port 25 then this port can be opened up on the network router to allow spam from the internet to reach the SMTP server. The server will then accept all of the incoming SMTP data and log this in a SQLite database. This will allow a network to be monitored to see where the SMTP traffic is coming from. The fact the server is able to log the incoming message along with any attachment means that it may be possible for the server to acquire malware and store it. It is possible to run the server using a cron job. This will allow each server to run for a short period of time and each time creates a new database. The database that will be created will be named using a timestamp as its name so that data can be collected over specific periods of time, providing smaller amounts of data that can be analysed. As the database is SQLite it can be taken separately and analysed in a secure location so that any malware that has been logged can be analysed correctly. The server can therefore act as a key component in a network to stop unwanted traffic. Modification of the server is possible enabling emails to be passed to their expected destinations.
